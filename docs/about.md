**UW Course Map** is an open‑source tool that helps University of Wisconsin–Madison students explore course offerings, plan their academic path, and ultimately leverage data to make informed decisions about their education.

## Problem Statement

- **Course Details**: View detailed information about each course, including prerequisites, co-requisites, and course descriptions.
- **Professor Ratings**: Quickly access ratings and reviews of professors for each course.
