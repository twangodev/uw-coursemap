**UW Course Map** is an open‑source tool that helps University of Wisconsin–Madison students explore course offerings, plan their academic path, and ultimately leverage data to make informed decisions about their education.

## Problem Statement

The University of Wisconsin–Madison has 10,000+ courses spanning 190+ departments. With so many options, it can be challenging to navigate the course catalog and find the right courses for your academic goals. Students often struggle to understand the relationships between courses, leading to confusion and frustration when planning their schedules.

## Features

- **Course Requisite Graph**: Visualize the relationships between courses and their prerequisites using a graph.
- **Course Details**: View detailed information about each course, including prerequisites, co-requisites, and course descriptions.
- **Professor Ratings**: Quickly access ratings and reviews of professors for each course.
- **Course Search**: Search for courses by name, code, or subject.

## Moving Forward

- If you would like new features or even implement them yourself, please check out our [Contributing Guide](./contributing.md).
- Our datasets and endpoints are open to the public. If you're curious about how we built this, check out our [API Documentation](usage/static-api.md)
